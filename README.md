# PCCM_Preliminary_Data_Analysis_UCL_CATS
This repository is to present some preliminary data analysis of transported ICU children in a pilot research work carried out by UCL and CATS team.
This work will be submited to the "Pediatric Critical Care Medicine" journal with a title of "Distribution and trajectory of vital signs from high-frequency continuous monitoring during paediatric critical care transport".

This work is a collaborative work between University College London, Great Ormand, Great Ormond Street Hospital, and Children’s Acute Transport Service (CATS) team.
The aim is to improve healthcare of critically ill children during transport using data (e.g., EHR, vital sign, and transport data).
 This was a retrospective cohort study analysing continuously monitored physiologic variables of critically ill children (age ≤18 years) transported to PICUs by the CATS team, a regional PCCT based in London, between 1 July 2016 and 30 May 2021.
