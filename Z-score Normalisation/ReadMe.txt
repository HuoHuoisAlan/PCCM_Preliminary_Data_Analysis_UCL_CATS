Some vital signs are age-dependent for the paediatric population, such as heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and blood pressures (systolic, mean and diastolic). We applied Z-score to normalise the analysed transported children's vital signs to eliminate the age difference in vital signs. We considered centile charts for the HR and RR reference values reported in [1]. For systolic and diastolic blood pressure values, we referred to the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's blood pressure tables organised by age, gender, and height [2]. Our analysis considered the MBP references for normal children as reported by [3]. We calculated Z-scores for BP by selecting children with the median height and calculating Z-score values separately for boys and girls (the detailed Z-score calculation procedure can be found in the Supplementary Materials).
It is noteworthy that there are very few evidence-based blood pressure guidelines for neonates and infants aged 0 to 1 year, to the best of our knowledge. Blood pressure changes can be significant in preterm infants, depending on a variety of factors. To provide clinicians with a rough reference range, we empirically adjusted the blood pressure reference values for children aged 0 to 1 year by consulting paediatric transport intensivists and clinicians. Following Z-score normalisation, the vital sign distributions are examined at the population level in terms of disease groups and outcome groups throughout the transport.
